i need a python script that is a "wrapper" meaning that it functions like the time cmd, it executes the next arg as the command, and passes all subsequent args as args to the command-- but prior, during, and following the execution, the script runs additional processes to monitor the session, including the process executing the wrapped command and all child processes
ChatGPT

Creating a Python script that acts as a wrapper to execute a command and monitor the session can be achieved using Python's subprocess module for running the external command, and potentially the psutil module for monitoring the processes. This script will:

    Take a command and its arguments as input.
    Execute the command while capturing its start time and end time.
    Monitor and log details about the process and its child processes before, during, and after its execution.

First, ensure you have the psutil library installed, which helps in retrieving information on running processes. You can install it using pip:

bash

pip install psutil

Here's a basic version of the Python script that functions as a wrapper:

python

import subprocess
import psutil
import sys
import time

def monitor_processes(initial_procs):
    """ Monitor and log details about specified processes. """
    for proc in initial_procs:
        try:
            p = psutil.Process(proc.pid)
            print(f"PID: {p.pid}, Name: {p.name()}, CPU usage: {p.cpu_percent(interval=1)}%, Memory: {p.memory_info().rss}")
        except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied):
            print(f"Process {proc.pid} no longer exists or access denied.")

def main(command, *args):
    """ A wrapper to execute a command, monitor and log the process details. """
    try:
        # Start monitoring processes
        initial_procs = list(psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name']))
        
        # Start the process
        print("Starting the command...")
        start_time = time.time()
        process = subprocess.Popen([command] + list(args), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

        # Monitor during execution
        try:
            while True:
                monitor_processes([process])
                if process.poll() is not None:
                    break
                time.sleep(1)  # Delay for a bit to avoid too much logging
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Monitoring interrupted.")

        # Collect outputs
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        end_time = time.time()
        
        # Final monitoring snapshot
        print("Command finished. Final process details:")
        monitor_processes([process])

        # Output results
        print(f"Command executed in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds.")
        print("STDOUT:", stdout.decode())
        print("STDERR:", stderr.decode())

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to execute command: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        main(sys.argv[1], *sys.argv[2:])
    else:
        print("Usage: python wrapper.py <command> [arguments...]")

How to Use the Script

    Save the script as wrapper.py.
    Run it from the command line by specifying the command and any arguments you want to pass to it. For example:

    bash

    python wrapper.py ls -l /home

This script will print out process details before and during the execution of the command and show the command output and execution time. You can extend this script by adding more sophisticated monitoring features or integrating with other tools for specific monitoring needs.

add shebang and use as a terminal command in the $PATH
ChatGPT

To use the Python script as a terminal command, we'll add a shebang line at the beginning of the script and provide instructions on how to make the script executable and accessible from anywhere in the system by adding it to the $PATH.
Step 1: Add Shebang Line

Add the following shebang line at the top of your Python script (wrapper.py). This line tells the system that the script should be run using Python.

python

#!/usr/bin/env python3

Step 2: Update the Script

Here's your updated script with the shebang included:

python

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess
import psutil
import sys
import time

def monitor_processes(initial_procs):
    """ Monitor and log details about specified processes. """
    for proc in initial_procs:
        try:
            p = psutil.Process(proc.pid)
            print(f"PID: {p.pid}, Name: {p.name()}, CPU usage: {p.cpu_percent(interval=1)}%, Memory: {p.memory_info().rss}")
        except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied):
            print(f"Process {proc.pid} no longer exists or access denied.")

def main(command, *args):
    """ A wrapper to execute a command, monitor and log the process details. """
    try:
        # Start monitoring processes
        initial_procs = list(psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name']))
        
        # Start the process
        print("Starting the command...")
        start_time = time.time()
        process = subprocess.Popen([command] + list(args), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

        # Monitor during execution
        try:
            while True:
                monitor_processes([process])
                if process.poll() is not None:
                    break
                time.sleep(1)  # Delay for a bit to avoid too much logging
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Monitoring interrupted.")

        # Collect outputs
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        end_time = time.time()
        
        # Final monitoring snapshot
        print("Command finished. Final process details:")
        monitor_processes([process])

        # Output results
        print(f"Command executed in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds.")
        print("STDOUT:", stdout.decode())
        print("STDERR:", stderr.decode())

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to execute command: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        main(sys.argv[1], *sys.argv[2:])
    else:
        print("Usage: python wrapper.py <command> [arguments...]")

Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Change the permissions of your script to make it executable. You can do this with the following command in your terminal:

bash

chmod +x wrapper.py

Step 4: Add to $PATH

To make the script accessible from anywhere on your system, move it to a directory that's included in your $PATH. A common location is /usr/local/bin/, but you can choose another if it fits your configuration better.

bash

sudo mv wrapper.py /usr/local/bin/wrapper

Now, you should be able to call the script from anywhere in your terminal just by typing wrapper followed by your command and its arguments. For example:

bash

wrapper ls -l /home

This setup lets you use the wrapper as a regular terminal command across your system.

make it a native python -- ie no pip install pyutil
ChatGPT

If you prefer to create a native Python wrapper script without using the psutil library, you'll need to rely on native modules like subprocess and perhaps os to manage and monitor processes. However, without psutil, your options for monitoring detailed metrics about processes (like memory and CPU usage) become limited.

Here's a revised version of the script that does not require psutil. This version can monitor the process by checking its existence and status, but it lacks the ability to fetch CPU or memory usage details:

python

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import subprocess
import sys
import time
import os

def monitor_process(pid):
    """ Monitor and log basic details about the process. """
    try:
        # Check if the process is still running
        os.kill(pid, 0)
        print(f"Process {pid} is still running.")
    except OSError:
        print(f"Process {pid} has terminated.")

def main(command, *args):
    """ A wrapper to execute a command, monitor and log the process details. """
    try:
        # Start the process
        print("Starting the command...")
        start_time = time.time()
        process = subprocess.Popen([command] + list(args), stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

        # Monitor during execution
        try:
            while True:
                monitor_process(process.pid)
                if process.poll() is not None:
                    break
                time.sleep(1)  # Delay for a bit to avoid too much logging
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Monitoring interrupted.")

        # Collect outputs
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        end_time = time.time()
        
        # Output results
        print(f"Command executed in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds.")
        print("STDOUT:", stdout.decode())
        print("STDERR:", stderr.decode())

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to execute command: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        main(sys.argv[1], *sys.argv[2:])
    else:
        print("Usage: wrapper <command> [arguments...]")

Steps to Make It a Terminal Command

Step 1: Save the script in a file named wrapper.py.

Step 2: Make the script executable:

bash

chmod +x wrapper.py

Step 3: Move it to a directory in your $PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin/):

bash

sudo mv wrapper.py /usr/local/bin/wrapper

Step 4: Use the script by calling wrapper followed by your command:

bash

wrapper ls -l /home

Limitations

This script only checks if the process is still running and does not gather detailed metrics about CPU and memory usage. For more detailed process monitoring without third-party libraries, you would typically need to directly parse system files like those in /proc on Linux systems, which can be complex and not easily portable across different operating systems.
